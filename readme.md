Introduction to the Commercial Cloud (an RC Primer)
CU Boulder Research Computing Cloud Foundation Service provides access to centrally provisioned public cloud services for administrative, teaching & learning, and research needs. This includes new and existing applications, big data workloads and other workloads well suited to the major public cloud services, including Amazon Web Service, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.

This RC Primer* training session will provide a high level overview of Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure’s commercial cloud services. We’ll first introduce cloud computing concepts, then dive into the console of both services and explore their basic features. We will conclude with resources for learning and getting started, including a run down of the Cloud Foundations Service. This session includes live demos, but participants are not expected to follow along.

 

* What is an RC Primer?: An RC Primer is a session that provide an introduction to concepts, systems, and tools. You can expect to leave "Primers" with an introductory-level understanding of the topic.
